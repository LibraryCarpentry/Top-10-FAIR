## Description
Governments have a mandate to make non-sensitive data open. For example, the Australian [Government Public Data Policy Statement](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/public-data/australian-government-public-data-policy-statement) says  “Australian Government entitites will ... make non-sensitive data open by default...make high value data available for use by the public, industry and academia... ensure non-sensitive publicly funded research data is made open for use and reuse... to extend the value of public data for the benefit of the Australian public.” FAIR data is a way to extend the value of data. The largest 20 nations, the G20, agreed to make [Open Data Principles](http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf) a priority at the 2015 meeting in Turkey, saying “Transparency... Global transformation, facilitated by technology, fuelled by data and information.. Open data is at the center of this global shift.” (p.2).

## Audience
Government data custodians

## Goal
Help government data custodians to understand FAIR data principles

# NB: Nomenclature and data:  
Where “data” is used here, we also mean collections such as Cultural Collections, historical collections, documents, artefacts and other valuable collections.

##### Beginner Activity 
**International**
G20: Open Government Forum; G20 Turkey 2015. “Transparency... Global transformation, facilitated by technology, fuelled by data and information.. Open data is at the center of this global shift.” (p.2) Read and consider G20 [Open Data Principles](http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf). 

Familiarise yourself with your State or Territories Data Policy. See links in [Appendix 1](#Appendix-1).

**Australia** 

* [Public data policy statement](https://www.pmc.gov.au/public-data/public-data-policy) 
[Office of the Australian Information Commissioner: Principles on open public sector information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/principles-on-open-public-sector-information)
  * Principle 1: Open access to information — a default position
“information held by Australian Government agencies is a valuable national resource. If there is no legal need to protect the information it should be open to public access.”
  * Principle 3: Effective information governance
“ensuring agency compliance with legislative and policy requirements on information management and publication”
  * Principle 4: Robust information asset management
  * Principle 5: Discoverable and useable information
“ensure that information published online is in an open and standards-based format and is machine-readable”
“attach high quality metadata to information so that it can be easily located and linked to similar information using standard web search applications”
  * Principle 6: Clear reuse rights
“The economic and social value of public sector information is enhanced when it is made available for reuse on open licensing terms.”

See Appendix 1 for a list of Australian State Open Data Policies.

##### Intermediate Activity

The following legislation may apply to the management of government data:

* Archives Act 1983 - https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00772
* Freedom of Information - http://my.csiro.au/Support-Services/Legal/FOI.aspx
* Privacy - http://my.csiro.au/Support-Services/Legal/Privacy-Law.aspx

* New Aus Govt Sharing and Release Legislation (open for public comment, shows where legislation is going): https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/australian-government-data-sharing-release-legislation_issues-paper.docx



##### Advanced Activity

If your organisation doesn’t have a policy on open data, who are the key stakeholders that you would need to work with to prepare an open data policy? 

What main headings would you need to include as part of your data policy? 


### Thing 2: Open data vs FAIR data

Read https://www.go-fair.org/faq/ask-question-difference-fair-data-open-data/ 
Can you think of examples of data you deal with that cannot be made Open but can be made FAIR?
List some advantages in making this data FAIR.

Does the current wording in the policy for Open Data encourage making the data FAIR? Where do you see gaps?

See slide 14 here https://www.slideshare.net/sjDCC/open-fair-data-and-rdm 

##### Beginner Activity

See how Geoscience Australia implement the FAIR data principles in their work. Geoscience Australia describe themselves as “the nation's trusted advisor on the geology and geography of Australia” (GA 2018).

##### Advanced Activity

How FAIR is your data? - https://www.ands-nectar-rds.org.au/fair-tool
Suggest using this now, and then finishing off the modules, making some changes to a data collection and then testing again using the FAIR data tool.


### Thing 3: Data discovery

* What’s a data repository?
* What’s a data portal?
* Where to find data? 
* Where to store data?

* Data.gov.au (and search.data.gov.au!) - find - this is an aggregator
See https://data.gov.au/dataset/list-of-australian-government-data-portals for a list of Australian Gov Data Portals (current as of March 2017). Some other data portals appear on https://data.gov.au/harvest. 
* [CSIRO DAP](https://data.csiro.au/dap/home?execution=e1s1) - find/store
* [National Map](https://nationalmap.gov.au/) - find
* Re3data.org  - registry of research repositories (etc)

###### International Gov Data Portals

* United Kingdom - https://data.gov.uk/
* New Zealand - https://www.data.govt.nz/ 
* Canada - https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data 
* United States of America - https://www.data.gov/
* India - https://data.gov.in/
* Finland - https://vm.fi/en/opendata    
* Singapore - https://data.gov.sg

### Thing 4: Describing your data or collection

* Including a description of data. What should go in a description?
* What makes a good description? See [ANDS Content Providers Guide on descriptions](https://documentation.ands.org.au/display/DOC/Description) -> Best Practice -> Writing good descriptions
* Write the description for a reader who has a general familiarity with a research area but is not a specialist—this will make data more accessible for cross-disciplinary use.
* Don't use specialist acronyms or obscure jargon.
* Don't assume a reader has specialist knowledge.

Some reusable content here - https://ecu.au.libguides.com/10-marine-science-rdm-things/Thing6 

##### Beginner Activity
Read a data description on data.gov.au  eg [Arts Victoria](https://www.data.gov.au/organization/artsvictoria), [ABC](https://www.data.gov.au/organization/australianbroadcastingcorporation) or Research data Australia
Eg [National Archive of Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors/national-archives-of-australia), [Australian Antarctic Data Centre](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors/australian-antarctic-data-centre), [CSIRO](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors/commonwealth-scientific-and-industrial-research-organisation) (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Org), [Geoscience Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors/geoscience-australia).

**Reflection**: Could you understand the description? Can you think of someone for whom this data or collection would be useful? Was it clear where to go next to access the data, or to ask for more information about this data or collection? What else would you like to know about this data/collection?  

**Activity**: Post your questions or responses to the reflection above to: the data custodian, or the comments section at data.gov.au.

##### Intermediate Activity

If you are a data custodian/researcher, consider your five most important datasets, that you have contributed to or that you manage. Pick the most important dataset to describe.

1. Start with: Title, Author, Year, Institution, Location/URL. This is the minimum description required to get a DOI (a permanent identifier). The URL for a DOI is the home page for the dataset description. If you don’t have one, make a person’s contact the URL.
  * (Hint: if you get stuck with the description, copy the abstract of a paper or conference paper or annual report, which uses or references your dataset. Edit the abstract to talk only about the data.)

Q: What type of data identifier does a government data custodian have?

2. Add more rich description to your data description eg subjects, grant IDs (where applicable - [RDA](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/grants); the Australian National Data Catalogue, has permanent URLs for Australian ARC and NHMRC grants). Include a significant statement about why the dataset is important.

3. Ask a colleague in a related field if they can understand your description. This helps the description be broadly readable by someone who is not deeply knowledgeable in your field. This will ensure that your description is more broadly understood.

##### Advanced Activity
Publish your data description on your resume, especially if online e.g. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). Send your data description to your data librarian, for addition to your Institutional Repository or Data Portal.
Alternatively, post your description to a public cloud service, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) or [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/). No data need be included. A description record is valuable in itself as it reveals the existence of data, previously unknown and inaccessible.

### Thing 5: Identifiers

To make data findable, It has to be uniquely and persistently stored with an identifier. A digital object identifier (DOI) is a unique, case-insensitive, alphanumeric character sequence and can be very helpful for this purpose. See also [ANDS Guide: Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) System for Research Data]](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/715155/Digital-Object-Identifiers.pdf).


See who mints ANDS DOIs, including NSW Office of Heritage and Environment, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, Geoscience Australia, Dept of Environment.

Types of persistent identifiers:

* DOI
* Handle
* IGSN

**Videos**

Watch the video Persistent identifiers and data citation explained by Research Data Netherlands - https://youtu.be/PgqtiY7oZ6k

Read about [persistent identifiers](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awareness) on a very general level (awareness).
DOI requires five fields; author, title, year, publisher, URL of DOI landing page.

##### Beginner Activity

Visit http://www.doi.org/ and try resolving these DOI numbers:

10.26179/5bf63428ea2a1
10.26186/5b76556b396c0

### Thing 6: Licensing
See the [licensing guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/research-data-rights-management): what is the appropriate licence for data produced by a government agency?

**Refer to** [AU Govt Data Statement](https://www.pmc.gov.au/public-data/public-data-policy)**:**
“At a minimum, Australian Government entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data by default: ...under a __*Creative Commons By Attribution licence*__ (ie CC_BY licence) unless a clear case is made to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for another open licence.”

Specific CC licences, which require DPC  approval, include NC - non-commercial, SA - share alike, and the very restrictive (and not-recommended ANDS) ND - no derivatives allowed.


Examples of licensing statements:

### Thing 7: Dirty data

Why is ”clean” data important? Public policy, changes to medical protocols and economic decisions all depend on accurate and complete data. See further at ECU resource which looks at the why and what of “dirty data.”

https://ecu.au.libguides.com/10-marine-science-rdm-things/Thing10 


##### Beginner Activity

Read this case study. The Data Retriever automates the tasks of finding, downloading, and cleaning up publicly available data, and then stores them in a variety of databases and file formats. This lets data analysts spend less time cleaning up and managing data, and more time analysing it.

### Thing 8: Working with sensitive data
What is sensitive data?

FAIR data doesn’t need to be published as open data. See Thing 2.

### Thing 9: Vocabularies - Assisting with interoperability

##### Beginner Activity
Controlled vocabularies for data description

In addition to selecting a metadata standard or schema, whenever possible you should also use a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary provides a consistent way to describe data - location, time, place name, and subject.

Controlled vocabularies significantly improve data discovery. It makes data more shareable with researchers in the same discipline because everyone is ‘talking the same language’ when searching for specific data e.g. plants, animals, medical conditions, places etc

1. Start by browsing Controlling your Language: a Directory of Metadata Vocabularies from JISC in the UK. Make sure you scroll down to 5. Conclusion - it’s worth a read.

##### Advanced Activity
Have a browse around the stunning level of data description and data contained in the [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au/).

### Thing 10

##### Data Impact

Data reuse - It is hard to check/track when you don’t have persistent identifiers and there’s not much of a data citation culture.

Web stats
Selected data.gov.au web analytics - https://search.data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-9fa9bfda-96b3-4214-8a09-497af105524b/details?q=data.gov.au

Some old uses of open data: https://data.gov.au/showcase

Use in GovHack(AU) - https://twitter.com/govhackau?lang=en

Tracking identifiers - data citation

##### Beginner Activity
Looking at the broader impact of how the data has been used and the benefits it has brought to society, industry, economy, etc. is a richer source of impact evidence than just looking at citations.

https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/articulating-the-value-of-open-data/data-engagement-and-impact



#### Postscript: Other topics to consider: 
* **Data People** - data technologists, data librarians, data trainers, data leaders, data scientists
* **Data Governance** - policy, procedure, planning, improving systems, request funding, build business cases for change
* **Data Training** - when: induction, checkups, when problems occur; what? Store, describe, how and why do data. Advanced topics eg sensitive data, spatial data, vocabularies, provenance.

See for example slide 54 in this [Data Readiness](https://www.slideshare.net/RichardFerrers/the-national-eresearch-and-data-management-landscape-cdu-data-readiness-training-nov-18) slideshow as well as the 24th edition of [Share](https://www.ands.org.au/news-and-events/share-newsletter/share-24) (cover shown below).
