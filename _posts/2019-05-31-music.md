## Thing 1: What is musical data?

As noted in [this paper](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt611_06/downie_mir_arist37.pdf) on Music Information Retrieval, music is multirepresentational, multicultural, multiexperiential, and multidisciplinary. Musical data therefore encompasses a wide range of types and formats, including symbolic representations such as scores, audio recordings, images of manuscripts, and information about works, performances and composers. In many cases, researchers may not think of such resources as ‘data’, instead referring to primary or secondary sources, reference works, databases, notes or annotations.

**Activity 1**: Discussion

*   What kinds of data do you work with? Do you primarily work with physical or digital objects? Do you work with multiple representations or formats? 
*   Are some types of data easier or more difficult to make and keep FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable? 

**Activity 2**: Go to [Digital Resources in Musicology](https://drm.ccarh.org/ ) (DRM) and review the top level categories. Which of these are relevant to your work? 


## Thing 2: Catalogues and repositories of musical data

Musical data is often organised into meaningful collections: groups of musical resources (recordings, scores, transcriptions, biographies, etc.) that make sense together and revolve around a central topic (a period, musician, genre, instrument, culture, etc.). These collections (or catalogues/repositories) are usually hard to find. This is why libraries have index cards, and databases have metadata: so users can browse and search them in order to reach the data they need.

**Activity 1**: Discussion

*   What are the musical data catalogues, collections and repositories most frequently used in your field? 
*   Where are these typically deposited? Do these depositing services suit your requirements well? 
*   Have you used institutional, domain-specific or generic repositories (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) to share your data?

**Activity 2**: In [this paper](https://www.albertmeronyo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WHiSe_2017_paper_13-1.pdf) on Characterising the Landscape of Musical Data on the Web, the authors tried to find, and describe, as many Web music catalogues as possible. These are published in the [musoW (Musical Data on the Web) registry](http://musow.kmi.open.ac.uk). Are catalogues and collections of your domain covered in [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aT-Jcf-8esUvKsXbY20SC-RROxehukUI7uigruQT6Z4/edit?usp=sharing)? If not, please add them at the end of the table.

## Thing 3: Metadata

[Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) can be defined as data about data. Metadata commonly describe characteristics such as format, contents, creator and publication date. This information is often captured using a metadata schema, which are designed to capture a common set of information in a structured manner. Whether you are searching for data or depositing a dataset, remember that the quality of the metadata captured influences how easily data can be found and potentially reused. In short, richer metadata increases findability. 

**Activity 1**: Choose one catalogue from Thing 2. This could be, for example, your favourite PDF score collection. Then, browse [schema.org](https://schema.org/) and look for properties you could use to accurately describe that collection’s metadata (author, time, genre, location, etc.). Most of them will be [metadata describing datasets](https://schema.org/Dataset). Are there any music-specific properties in schema.org (or elsewhere) you would use?

**Activity 2**: Go to [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) and try to find your chosen dataset out of Thing 2. Is it there? Why do you think it is (not)?

## Thing 4: Persistent identifiers

Persistent identifiers are long-lasting references to a resource, like a document, webpage, file, or music score. They are designed to uniquely identify such resources, and to be actionable upon them: a protocol is typically able to retrieve the content they represent from them (see Thing 5).

There are two important issues about persistent identifiers and musical data: object level identification, and persistent identifier providers. Object level identification refers to the granularity and level of detail for the object for which the identifier is being created. Does the identifier represent a whole musical collection, an item inside that collection, a score within that item, a page of that score, a note within that page, an annotation? Persistent identifier providers refer to the institutional service that generates the identifiers and ensures that they will function permanently. Regular URLs (web addresses) can perform this role with adequate maintenance; but institutionally maintained identifiers (such as [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) and [PURLs](https://archive.org/services/purl/)) typically do this maintenance externally.

**Activity 1**: Discussion

*   What are the musical objects (collections, databases, database entries, pages, scores, recordings, metadata, etc.) that get permanent identifiers in your domain? 
*   What are these identifiers typically used for? 
*   Would identifiers representing more fine-grained musical objects (i.e. notes) be useful?

**Activity 2**:

*   Create an account at [purl.org](https://archive.org/services/purl/)
*   Create a new domain
*   Create PURLs pointing to musical objects on the Web that you consider important
*   Add those PURLs to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIajjosl-wPM1ifb8woMtJ-f9Ar-gpvaDG_zE7PBhBQ/edit?usp=sharing)


## Thing 5: Standards and protocols

We have seen so far that stable, eternal identifiers are useful to name and find musical resources. But how can we use these identifiers to _access_ the data they represent? Accessing the data behind identifiers is what we do, for example, when we physically go to a designated library location, or when we write a URL in our Web browser and hit enter. Interestingly, these things can also be done by automated agents (robots, programs). Both humans and machines need a standard, open, free, universally understood and authenticated protocol (so: a systematic sequence of steps) to perform this access. On the Web, URLs are preferred for identifying (musical) things, and the protocol to access the content they represent is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Despite its initial purpose to transport HTML pages from servers to Web browsers, HTTP can be used to access Web data of any kind.

**Activity 1**:

*   Find the DBpedia URI identifying a famous band or song, by appending its name to the prefix [http://dbpedia.org/resource](http://dbpedia.org/resource). For example, for The Beatles you would have [http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Beatles](http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Beatles)
*   Paste that URI in the address bar of your browser, and observe the (HTML) results
*   Open a terminal in your system ([Windows](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-open-terminal-in-windows), [MacOS](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac), [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu)), type the command `'curl -L -H'Accept: text/turtle' http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Beatles'` (without the quotes and with your chosen band or song), and observe the results. What are the differences with respect to what was shown in the browser? What similitudes?


## Thing 6: Encoding standards

Apart from identifying resources uniquely, a key aspect of sharing them is to make them readable and actionable by other users and applications. This is valid for any relevant resource that is published on the Web. However, a large number of music activities depend on some musical content. When reusing musical objects from the Web, a key problem is the compatibility of the format with the target tool. Therefore, a number of standards have been developed by the community of researchers and practitioners to represent music scores and making it usable across applications. These include (but are not limited to):

*   MEI - [https://music-encoding.org/](https://music-encoding.org/)
*   MusicXML - [https://www.musicxml.com/](https://www.musicxml.com/)
*   ABC - [http://abcnotation.com/](http://abcnotation.com/)
*   LilyPond - [http://lilypond.org/](http://lilypond.org/)
*   MIDI and XMF [https://www.midi.org/specifications](https://www.midi.org/specifications)

**Activity 1**: Collect scores of the same song in different standards and compare them: do they include the same information? 

*   ABC tune examples - [http://abcnotation.com/tunes](http://abcnotation.com/tunes)
*   MIDI song examples - [https://github.com/albertmeronyo/awesome-midi-sources](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/awesome-midi-sources) 
*   MEI examples - [https://github.com/music-encoding/sample-encodings](https://github.com/music-encoding/sample-encodings)  
*   MusicXML examples - [https://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/](https://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/) 
*   LilyPond examples - [https://www.mutopiaproject.org/](https://www.mutopiaproject.org/) 

**Activity 2**: Choose a tool/application you are familiar with and check which formats are supported and which ones are not. Request the missing feature to the organisation or community that supports the development.

**Activity 3**: Once a score is encoded according to a particular standard, how is it rendered? One tool for rendering MEI files is Verovio. Go to Verovio’s MEI viewer at [https://www.verovio.org/mei-viewer.xhtml](https://www.verovio.org/mei-viewer.xhtml) and use the navigation menu to turn pages, zoom in/out and switch between examples. Verevio is used in a range of projects, including digital editions of [Beethoven](https://demo2.beethovens-werkstatt.de/index.html ) and [Mozart](https://dme-webdev.mozarteum.at/movi/en). 


## Thing 7: Ontologies

[Ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_engineering) are representations of concepts and their relations according to the meaning they have in a specific community. Standard formats like the one discussed above have the purpose of encoding information in a symbolic form. However, they generally lack details about the _meaning_ of the symbols used, that is specified outside, usually on a documentation manual. Ontologies aim at expressing the meaning of the symbols used with a high degree of formalisation. 

Ontologies are defined using Semantic Web standards: [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), and [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language). Web ontologies can be useful to publish Linked Data on the Web (see below). Domain ontologies are developed with the purpose of representing concepts which belong to a specific part of the world, such as biology, social media, … or music!

Music ontologies vary from metadata standards to sophisticated schemas to represent music-related objects. Some examples are:

*   DOREMUS - [https://www.doremus.org/](https://www.doremus.org/) ([http://data.doremus.org/ontology/](http://data.doremus.org/ontology/)) 
*   Music Ontology - [http://purl.org/ontology/mo/](http://purl.org/ontology/mo/) 
*   Chord Ontology - [http://purl.org/ontology/chord/](http://purl.org/ontology/chord/) 
*   Music Theory Ontology - [http://purl.org/ontology/mto/](http://purl.org/ontology/mto/) 
*   Temperament Ontology - [http://purl.org/ontology/temperament/](http://purl.org/ontology/temperament/) 
*   MusicNote - [http://cedric.cnam.fr/isid/ontologies/MusicNote.owl#](http://cedric.cnam.fr/isid/ontologies/MusicNote.owl#) 
*   MusicOWL - [http://linkeddata.uni-muenster.de/ontology/musicscore/](http://linkeddata.uni-muenster.de/ontology/musicscore/) 

**Activity 1**: Find a music ontology on the Web. What is the aspect of Music whose _meaning_ it describes? A starting point for your search could be [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs ). 

**Activity 2**: Find projects using music ontologies. What is the ontology useful/used for? For example, have a look at [JazzCats](http://jazzcats.cdhr.anu.edu.au/) and its data structures [http://jazzcats.cdhr.anu.edu.au/documentation/](http://jazzcats.cdhr.anu.edu.au/documentation/) Which classes and properties are from existing ontologies?


## Thing 8: Linked Data

[Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) is a way of representing structured data using the Resource Description Framework ([RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)), so multiple datasets can be easily connected and queried together via the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language ([SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL)). The Web community has linked so far more than [1,200 datasets](https://lod-cloud.net/) and 200 billion statements.

**Activity 1**:

*   Go to [https://lod-cloud.net/](https://lod-cloud.net/) and find datasets related to your musical interests. Observe their links to other (perhaps not so musical, but still related) datasets.
*   What other datasets do you know from your domain that would be interesting to link to? To what purpose?

**Activity 2**: [Awesome Semantic Web](https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web) enumerates a large number of Linked Data tools. Which of them do you think would be useful to support linking musical data? Which of them would support FAIR in musical data?

**Activity 3**: Get to know a few methods and platforms for navigating Linked Data resources:

*   Search the DOREMUS catalogue [http://overture.doremus.org/](http://overture.doremus.org/) 
*   Explore the Linked Jazz network visualisation [https://linkedjazz.org/network/](https://linkedjazz.org/network/) 
*   Run a sample SPARQL query using the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint [https://query.wikidata.org/](https://query.wikidata.org/) For example, [run the query](https://w.wiki/4VG) to return ‘paintings depicting musical instruments with some connection to Hamburg’. See the [query help page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/Wikidata_Query_Help) for more information about querying Wikidata. 
*   Search the MIDI Linked Data cloud [https://midi-ld.github.io/](https://midi-ld.github.io/), and send some queries to its SPARQL endpoint through its API [http://grlc.io/api/midi-ld/queries/](http://grlc.io/api/midi-ld/queries/)


## Thing 9: Licensing and provenance

Licensing is a key topic in music and musicology, since music has historically been a cultural asset with strong ties with industrial exploitation and copyright. At the same time, researchers that investigate music need musical data to be openly available, which sets a whole spectrum of compromise. At the same time, the high availability of musical assets opens questions about the provenance of the data: Who made them and why? When? What instruments and musicians were involved? These questions might be key for trusting musical catalogs and establishing standards of data quality.

**Activity 1**: Enumerate data licenses that are typically used in your field. What are their limitations? Are there types of musical data for which specific licenses suit better? Are there needs not covered by any such license? Examples of data licenses are:

*   [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) (CC0, CC BY-SA, etc.)
*   [Open Data Commons](https://opendatacommons.org/)
*   [Free Art License](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/fal/)
*   [Open Game License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)

**Activity 2**: Do you need guidance on how to license your research data? Read OpenAIRE’s guide on [how to apply licenses to research data](https://www.openaire.eu/how-do-i-license-my-research-data). 

**Activity 3**: Discuss practices and standards in recording provenance of musical data in your field. Is provenance recorded automatically, manually, or not at all? In what situations would provenance of musical data be useful or necessary?


## Thing 10: FAIR policies

The FAIR data principles have gained significant traction since their conception. Statements citing the importance of FAIR data can be found in the policies set by funders, higher education institutions, repositories, journals and publishers. For example, the [Enabling FAIR Data](http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/) initiative of the American Geophysical Union has been endorsed by a large number of publishers and repositories. Signatories to the initiative, such as [Nature](http://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-00075-3), aim to promote best practices for data sharing and have implemented policies that assist adherence to the FAIR principles. As research transitions towards a FAIRer future, what other policy developments do you expect to see in the next few years?

**Activity 1**: Discussion
*   Have you come across the FAIR principles, or aspects of the principles, in any policy documents? 
*   What are the research data policies of your local institution or national funding bodies?

**Activity 2**:

*   Read the brief data policy of the [Transactions of the International Society for Information Music Retrieval](https://transactions.ismir.net/) (TISMIR) at [https://transactions.ismir.net/about/editorialpolicies/](https://transactions.ismir.net/about/editorialpolicies/) (scroll to Reproducibility section).
*   Look up the data policy of another journal in your discipline or subdiscipline. What are the similarities or differences between policies? Is a data availability/accessibility statement required? Are there recommendations for depositing data in a trusted digital repository?

**Activity 3**: Read Tuomas Eerola’s blog on [Open Data in Music and Science](https://musicscience.net/2018/05/25/open-data-in-music-and-science/), which includes comments on education and advocacy. What steps could you take to promote good data management and data sharing practices amongst your students and colleagues?
